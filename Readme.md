This is an intelligent system which predicts words, lines or any length of text given a context. 
This is based upon recurrent neural networks, to be more precise LSTM's due to their long memory dependencies and decreased vanishing gradient problem. 
The model was made from scratch using tensorflow library in python which could be seen in the provided jupyter notebook. 
The model is quite efficient to predict next possible length of words without any realtime access to database. 
The Web Application is interactive enough with provided features so that to make it quite user friendly.
